####  In this project we're working with bits manipulation.

Exercise 0: Write a function that converts a binary to an uint.

Exercise 1: Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

Exercise 2: Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

Exercise 3: Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index

Exercise 4: Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index

Exercise 5: Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need

to flop to get from one number to another.
